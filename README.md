# Postcoder address lookup iOS example

Example iOS project which implements UI and code to interact with the [Postcoder address lookup API](https://www.alliescomputing.com/postcoder/address-lookup) from Allies

## Note

Be sure to change the `postcoderApiKey` variable in the postcoderClient.swift file, to use a trial key from Allies.

The test key that is included (PCW45-12345-12345-1234X) only works with the UK and always returns addresses from the NR14 7PZ postcode.

[Sign up for a trial on the Allies website](https://www.alliescomputing.com/postcoder/sign-up)
